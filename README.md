## OCaml Playground

As I play around with OCaml I figure I'll save my work in this repo as a collection of proof-of-concept scripts.

### Docs and Tests

There are (or will be) lots of `.ml.md` files in this directory. These are little sub-readme Markdown files that tell
you all about a given script.

_These `.ml.md` files are also tests._ If you have the [mdx package](https://ocaml.org/p/mdx/) installed, you can run
`make test` and it will detect code snippets in these files, along with their expected output, and automatically verify
they are correct.
